# COVID-19 Data Exploration
## Project Overview
This project involves a detailed exploration of COVID-19 data to uncover insights related to infection rates, death percentages, and comparisons by geographic locations. It uses advanced SQL techniques including joins, CTEs, temporary tables, window functions, and aggregate functions.

# Skills Demonstrated
SQL Joins: Merging data from multiple sources.
Common Table Expressions (CTEs): Simplifying complex queries.
Temporary Tables: Enhancing query performance and organization.
Window Functions: Calculating running totals and other metrics.
Aggregate Functions: Summarizing data to extract meaningful statistics.
Creating Views: Simplifying access to data subsets.

# Queries Included
Total Cases vs. Total Deaths: Analysis of the mortality likelihood if infected by COVID-19 in various countries.
Total Cases vs. Population: Examination of what percentage of the population has been infected in different locations.
Highest Infection and Death Rates: Identifying countries with the highest COVID-19 infection and death rates relative to their populations.
Continental Analysis: Breaking down data by continent to find regions with the highest death counts per population.
Global Summaries: Aggregating data to produce global COVID-19 statistics.
Data Source
The data used in this project is sourced from a comprehensive COVID-19 dataset, detailing various metrics like cases, deaths, and population statistics by location and date.
